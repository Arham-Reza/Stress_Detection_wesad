# Stress_Detection_wesad
Analyze physiological and motion WESAD dataset,used tsfresh package to obtain statistical features.The features obtained are passed through two filter methods
Mutual Information and Pearson Correlation Coefficient separately and the aggregate ranks are obtained using the proposed ensemble method. Finally, we have 
fed top-t% ranked features to the Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN and built a multi level stress Detection ML model.
